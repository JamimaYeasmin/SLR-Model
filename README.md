This case study is aimed at property sellers who want to determine the sale price of their property. Some factors that affect the price are apparent and obvious, while others are not. However, a rational approach that incorporates machine learning can be very useful in predicting property prices. A large dataset consisting of 79 different features such as living area, number of rooms, location, etc. along with their corresponding prices for residential homes is provided. The challenge is to learn the relationship between the important features and the price and use it to predict the prices of a new set of houses.
