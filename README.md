#Problem Statement:
#This Case study is related to property sellers to determine the sale price of the property. Some are apparent and obvious, and some are not. Nevertheless, a rational approach aided by machine learning can be very useful in predicting property prices. A large data set with 79 different features (like living area, number of rooms, location, etc) along with their prices are provided for residential homes. The challenge is to learn the relationship between the important features and the price. Further, use it to predict the prices of a new set of houses.
